    "From the visualization, we see that the concentration at the lower values is more pronounced for non-waterfront properties than for waterfront properties, which also gives us a sense that the two types of properties have fundamental price differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to visualize this is to instead look at the cumulative probability mass instead of each individual probability mass. Going back to the calculus that you might still remember, you're going to look at the integral of the probability density function rather than its values at specific points.\n",

    "We can answer a substantial amount of the search question by simply filtering the documents down to just the subset that contain the terms entered by the end user. It's important to note that this may result in false negatives (because sometimes documents contain synonyms of words rather than exact words), but we will temporarily accept that as a limitation, because we'll need additional math in order to overcome it.\n",
